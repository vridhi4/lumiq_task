This is a README file that contains Introduction to GIT and its features.

 

INTRODUCTION  

Git is an open-source distributed version control system. It is designed to handle minor to major projects with high speed and efficiency. It is developed to co-ordinate the work among the developers. The version control allows us to track and work together with our team members at the same workspace. 

 

Features of Git 

Open Source: Git is an open-source tool. It is released under the GPL (GeneraPublic License) license. 

Scalable: which means when the number of users increases, the Git can easily handle such situations. 

Distributed: One of Git's great features is that it is distributed. Distributed means that instead of switching the project to another machine, we can create a "clone" of the entire repository.  

Security: It uses the SHA1 (Secure Hash Function) to name and identify objects within its repository.  

Speed: Git is very fast, so it can complete all the tasks in a while. Most of the git operations are done on the local repository, so it provides a huge speed. Also, a centralized version control system continually communicates with a server somewhere.
